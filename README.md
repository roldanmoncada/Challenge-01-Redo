# **Challenge 01 Redo: Electric Boogaloo**

## <ins>Description: </ins>
    The first time I attempted this challenge I was not able to focus very well due to external, personal circumstances. Now I'm re-doing it with more mental bandwidth available. I'm still struggling a bit to understand how to consolidate CSS elements and how to replace non-semantic HTML items properly. So my plan at the moment is to continue re-doing this and other basic challenges in order to further develop my fundamentals of each language. I'm not so sure I'll be able to keep up the fun titles for all of them, but I will certainly try in the interest of keeping things fun and interesting.

    This application's expected outcome is a basic HTML and CSS website that holds several fundamental items such as headers, a navigation bar, a background image, several in-line boxes with images and content-describing paragraphs, among others. It will serve as a basic training exercise that I can continually build off of for personal and professional coding development.


## <ins>User Story: </ins>

``` 

## <ins>Acceptance Criteria: </ins>
``` 
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
